# partyguesser
This program is based upon a survey released by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/08/opinion/sunday/party-polarization-quiz.html), "Let Us Predict Whether
Youâ€™re a Democrat or a Republican." The survey goes through a series of social, seemingly non-politically inclined questions to determine the political party of the end user.
